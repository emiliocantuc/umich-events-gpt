Abstract: The goal of the field of topological data analysis (TDA) is to quantitatively encode and measure shape in data using Algebraic Topology. The available tools encompass both algebraic constructions (such as persistence diagrams and Euler characteristics) as well as graph based representations (such as Reeb graphs, mapper graphs, and merge trees). Applications of TDA have exploded in recent years, finding u ...</p>
