            <p class="card-text">Predicting how microbial communities respond to environmental change is crucial for managing their function in the face of changing climate, health, and disease. Yet these communities’ enormous diversity and complexity raises the question of whether it is possible to predict their dynamics. While the environment plays a direct role in selecting for particular species, measuring these direct effects may not be sufficient for making predictions, because the environment also indirectly alters inter ...</p>

Abstract: The goal of the field of topological data analysis (TDA) is to quantitatively encode and measure shape in data using Algebraic Topology. The available tools encompass both algebraic constructions (such as persistence diagrams and Euler characteristics) as well as graph based representations (such as Reeb graphs, mapper graphs, and merge trees). Applications of TDA have exploded in recent years, finding u ...</p>
