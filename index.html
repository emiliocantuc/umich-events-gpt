In the first part of this talk, we will discuss summary statistics of physics-based model outputs and their correction with observational data.
Physics-based models capture broad-scale dynamics across various spatial and temporal scales, they often face challenges such as modeling biases, high computational costs, along with large outputs that are challenging to manipulate. On the other ...</p>
