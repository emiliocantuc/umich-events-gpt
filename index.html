A little thought reveals that some of these concepts seem to be much more complicated than others.

However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. I identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. I  ...</p>
