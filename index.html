            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Apr 29 09:00 - 14:00. Conference / Symposium. Palmer Commons</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare in major ways. It has the potential to help clinicians make better diagnoses and offer personalized treatment, while also promising to revolutionize how healthcare is delivered. However, healthcare systems that deploy AI, and patients whose care is impacted by AI face many ethical considerations. How will access to appropriate data be balanced with privacy? Who is responsible for the quality of AI tools? Are AI technologies contributing to  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: In today's era of large-scale data, academic institutions, businesses, and government agencies are increasingly faced with heterogeneous datasets. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop effective methods for extracting meaningful insights from this type of data. Quantile, expectile, and expected shortfall regression methods offer useful tools to detect heteroscedasticity in data. Beyond traditional metrics like mean and variance, quantile, expectile, and superquantile (also k ...</p>
