            <p class="card-text">Homelessness is a significant and growing crisis in the United States. In an effort to more efficiently and fairly distribute limited housing resources, jurisdictions across the US have adopted <b>algo</b>rithmic prioritization systems to help select which unhoused people should receive resources. In this talk, we discuss how frontline bureaucrats mediate between the rigidity of the homeless services infrastructure and the messy social worlds of people experiencing homelessness.
