Abstract:
Over the years, I worked on designing ‘brand new’ (de novo) protein complexes—ordered and disordered—using <b>comput</b>ational tools such as Rosetta. I created large symmetric protein assemblies through the rigid helical fusion of smaller protein chains and later expanded this approach to design disordered system-wide protein networks with unique mechano-fluidic properties inside and outside of cells. Using these de novo protein complexes, I deve ...</p>

The development of quantum <b>comput</b>ers and simulators has opened new avenues for studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics through quantum simulation. In this talk, I will discuss how quantum simulation has deepened our understanding of quantum many-body chaos, thermalization, and their breakdown, with a focus on ergodicity breaking due to quantum many-body scar states. I will then discuss a recently proposed nonequilibrium quantum phase—strong-to-weak spontaneous symmet ...</p>
