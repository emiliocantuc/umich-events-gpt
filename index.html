            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The non-backtracking operator, an asymmetric matrix constructed from an undirected graph, connects to various aspects of graph theory, including random walks, graph zeta functions, and expander graphs. It has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing sparse random graphs, leading to significant advancements with established results for sparse random matrices using this operator. Additionally, algorithms employing the non-backtracking operator have achieved optimal sample complexity in m ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Nature has developed eloquent mechanisms for producing molecules through complex biosynthetic pathways consisting of enzymes as the primary molecular machines. Our goal is to hijack these metabolic pathways to create custom molecules for solving problems related to human health and the environment. The major challenges lie in understanding the mechanism of these dynamic pathways and decoding the relationship between enzyme sequence, structure, and function. Building upon state-of-the-art technol ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Exploration of the deep ocean has expanded our understanding of oceanic ecosystems and yet still little is known about these deep sites on Earth. Some of the most poorly understood ecosystems are subsurface sedimentary environments and ultra-deep trenches, particularly as it pertains to the distribution of novel microbial lineages and their associated metabolic abilities. In this presentation, I will share an two examples of work that has advance our understanding of the distribution and metabol ...</p>
