Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly powerful to support scientific research and development. A large emphasis in the pharmaceutical community has been on applying these tools in drug discovery, where algorithms promise to accelerate the earliest stages of drug development. However, a key challenge in applying <b>machine learning</b> to drug discovery is the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets for many important applications.

In existing literature, strategies of players are typically assigned scalar values, and the concept of Nash equilibrium is used to identify compatible strategies. However, this approach lacks the internal structure of a player, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors in reality. To address this limitation, we propose to characterize players by their learning <b>algo</b>rithms, and as their estimations intrinsically induce ...</p>
