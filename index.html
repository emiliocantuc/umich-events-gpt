We derive the implications of these symmetries on the particle spectrum of two dimensional QFTs.  We show that these symmetries often imply degeneracies between particles and solitons and apply our analyses to examples ranging from integrable deformations of minimal models to two-dimensional QCD.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Recently, the adapted Wasserstein (AW) distance has emerged as an attractive alternative to the usual distances between laws of stochastic processes due to its application to dynamic optimisation problems, such as optimal stopping, for example. However, similar to classical Wasserstein distance, the exact value of the AW distance is difficult to determine in general.
