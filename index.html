These models reproduce the same phases as ordinary QCD, while allowing us to probe confinement from a different dynamical perspective. Within this fr ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Recent empirical studies have shown that diffusion models possess a unique reproducibility property, transiting from memorization to generalization as the number of training samples increases. This demonstrates that diffusion models can effectively learn image distributions and generate new samples. Remarkably, these models achieve this even with a small number of training samples, despite the challenge of large image dimensions, effectively circumventing the curse of dimensionality. I ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract:  Waves propagating in media with periodic structures have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These media show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual materials constituting the stratified system. More recently, waves on fluids and gases with an underlying periodic structure have been studied.  These waves present a peculiar, somehow unexpected, behaviour. For example, there is evidence that in spite of the fact that the w ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">At the intersection of theatre, performance and media arts, √âmilie Monnet‚Äôs work is most often presented in the form of interdisciplinary theatre or performative installations. Her artistic approach favours collaborative and multilingual creative processes, and explores themes of memory, history, transformation and love. 
In 2011, she founded Onishka Productions to build bridges and nurture relationships between Indigenous artists and communities throughout the world, notably via the Indigenous  ...</p>
