            <p class="card-text">Avian gastrulation requires coordinated flows of thousands of cells to form the body plan. We quantified these flows using their fundamental kinematic units: one attractor and two repellers constituting its Dynamic Morphoskeleton (DM). We have also elucidated the mechanistic origin of the attractor, marking the primitive streak (PS), and controlled its shape, inducing gastrulation flows in the chick embryo that are typical of other vertebrates. However, the origins of repellers and dynamic embry ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">The 3D distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of cosmological information, including on the nature of Dark Energy and the origin of the Universe's structure. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration is in the process of producing the largest-ever map of this distribution by measuring galaxy redshifts. It is just over three years into its five-year survey and has already secured over 20 million redshifts --- a factor of 10 improvement on the total measured before DESI. Thi ...</p>
