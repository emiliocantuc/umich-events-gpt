            <p class="card-text">Abstract:
I will introduce some recent progress towards understanding the scalability of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and their comparative advantage with respect to variational inference. I will fact-check the folklore that "variational inference is fast but biased, MCMC is unbiased but slow." I will then discuss a combination of the two via reverse diffusion, which holds promise of solving some of the multi-modal problems. This talk will be motivated by the need for Bayesian <b>com ...</p>
