Mario L. Suvà, M.D., Ph.D.
Associate Professor of Pathology
Harvard Medical School

ABSTRACT: We will discuss recent efforts to characterize primary and recurrent gliomas with single-cell and spatial genomic technologies. We will also discuss efforts to model glioblastoma in the lab. We will place the findings in the broader context of the cellular architecture of brain tumors and of cancer cell states.

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Data is playing an increasingly crucial role in modern health sciences. With the transition to electronic health systems, growing collaborations among institutions, and the rapid advancement of genome sequencing technologies, health data has become more accessible than ever before. However, the large-scale nature of health data presents unique challenges for statistics and data science in distilling, integrating, and generalizing knowledge, due to its high dimensionality, diverse modal ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">In the past few years, the Indigenous movement has emerged as one of the strongest social movements in Brazil, embedded in a long history of resistance to settler colonialism and genocide. The land struggle carried out by the Tupinambá of Serra do Padeiro, in Southern Bahia, in the Northeast of the country, provides a striking example of Indigenous mobilization to assert territorial rights. In 2004, they began to carry out direct actions, called *retomadas de terras*, to recover their territory, ...</p>
