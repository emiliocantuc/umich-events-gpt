Moreover, the critical p-stabilization of a classical CM form is the image of a p-adic CM form, strengthening the fact that its Galois representation splits locally at p. In the GSp4 setting, the Galois representation of a Yoshida lift splits locally into two 2-by-2 blocks at p. In joint work in progress with Bharathwaj Palvanna ...</p>

The intelligence economy—the emerging system in which machines, data centers, and grids embody and deliver intelligence into everyday life—will only thrive if we can solve its energy challenges. On the embodied side, autonomous systems such as aircraft, robots, and heavy machines demand energy densities far beyond today’s lithium-ion batteries. While animals store energy at nearly 9 kWh/kg and operate continuously by consuming new fuel, robots typically run for only a fraction of the  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Deep learning has had a significant impact on both science and society due to its successful application of data-driven artificial intelligence. One of the key characteristics of deep learning is that its accuracy improves with an increase in the model size and the amount of training data. This feature has notably enhanced state-of-the-art learning architectures across various fields over the past decade.  However, the lack of a solid mathematical and statistical foundation has restric ...</p>
