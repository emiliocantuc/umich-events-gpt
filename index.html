Abstract: In studying the dynamics of stochastic complex systems, it is common to employ Monte Carlo sampling of trajectories because it is typically impractical to solve for the evolution of the probability distribution over exponentially large state spaces. In my talk, I will present a case study (PRX, 13, 041006, 2023) showing a numerically tractable route to studying the stochastic dynamics without sampling. ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Photonic materials, including plasmons and polaritons, are highly promising catalysts for driving energetically unfavorable chemical reactions with sunlight, due to their large optical cross sections and ability to modify potential energy landscapes. However, the efficiencies of most plasmon-driven and polariton-driven processes are quite low, likely due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of the underlying physical processes.
