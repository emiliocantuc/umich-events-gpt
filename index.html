I will describe an approach to checking this consequence via p-adic Hodge theory. We prove that for a smooth proper scheme X over Z_p with H^0(X, Omega^i)=0 the restriction map to the p-adic completion of de Rham cohomology ...</p>

Abstract:
Of 3.6 million live births in the US each year, over 370,000 are preterm, and there are about 21,000 stillbirths.  In addition to poor fetal outcomes, maternal mortality in the US is rising. Animal models of human pregnancy are limited, and there are reasonable ethical restrictions on experimentation with pregnant women. As a result, less is known about pregnancy than other aspects of human physiology. There are thus opportunities for tr ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Existing devices—such as phones, <b>comput</b>ers, and robots – are made from rigid materials, which is in direct contrast to the soft materials that compose the human body. Our group is studying and harnessing soft materials to create devices (actuators, sensors, electronics) with tissue-like properties. For example, gallium-based liquid metal alloys have remarkable properties: low melting point, water-like viscosity, low-toxicity, and effectively zero vapor pressure.  Despite being liquid, the ...</p>

Abstract:
Urban energy systems are growing in complexity as they respond to the challenges of planning location-specific energy transitions. However, current modeling approaches often fail to capture the physical, behavioral, and systemic diversity required for effective localized planning and decision-making.

In this talk, I will present integrated frameworks that combine bottom-up physics-based modeling with AI-driven analytics for characterizing urban energy s ...</p>
