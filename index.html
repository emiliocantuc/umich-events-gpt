            <p class="card-text">The Higgs boson, the cornerstone of the Standard Model, was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), marking a groundbreaking milestone in high-energy physics. Yet, critical questions—such as the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and the mass hierarchy—remain unanswered. Precision measurements of the Higgs boson and its interactions, especially at high energies, offer one of the most promising pathways to uncover new physics at the LHC.

            <p class="card-text">The mapping class group of 2-dimensional surfaces (of genus g) admits as a classifying space the moduli space M_g. This moduli space also happens to classify various structures of interest that one can consider on a surface (for ex. complex structures, conformal structures, Riemannian metrics,..), and a geometric model for this classifying space is obtained as the quotient of the Teichmuller space by the mapping class group.

            <p class="card-text">Electric vehicles (EVs) play a significant role in enhancing the sustainability of transportation systems. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by inadequate public charging infrastructure, particularly to support long-distance travel. Identifying optimal charging station locations in large transportation networks presents a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, as the search space grows exponentially with the number of potential charging station locations.
