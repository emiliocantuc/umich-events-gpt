            <p class="card-text">We introduce a 1-complex associated with a finite regular cover of the rose and show that it is connected if and only if the fundamental group of the associated cover is generated by elements in a proper <b>free </b>factor of the <b>free </b>group. When the associated cover represents a characteristic subgroup of the <b>free </b>group, the complex admits an action of Out(F_n) by isometries. We then explore the coarse geometry of the 1-complex, showing that every component has infinite diameter,  ...</p>
