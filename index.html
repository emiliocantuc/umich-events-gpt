            <p class="card-text">"The criminalization ritual fraternity traverses current writing on crime and criminalization, because it foregrounds not marginalization but a political form of fraternity – that the criminalizing state shares with the targeted social formations (some of which powerful). In 1982, Italy criminalized two kinds of associations: mafia-type organizations and secretive associations. Subsequent investigations and trials foregrounded the role of ritual brotherhood in the political imaginary of the Sici ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">We introduce a 1-complex associated with a finite regular cover of the rose and show that it is connected if and only if the fundamental group of the associated cover is generated by elements in a proper <b>free</b> factor of the <b>free</b> group. When the associated cover represents a characteristic subgroup of the <b>free</b> group, the complex admits an action of Out(F_n) by isometries. We then explore the coarse geometry of the 1-complex, showing that every component has infinite diameter,  ...</p>
