            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The non-backtracking operator, an asymmetric matrix constructed from an undirected graph, connects to various aspects of graph theory, including random walks, graph zeta functions, and expander graphs. It has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing sparse random graphs, leading to significant advancements with established results for sparse random matrices using this operator. Additionally, algorithms employing the non-backtracking operator have achieved optimal sample complexity in m ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract:  Traditional numerical methods based on expensive matrix factorizations struggle with the scale of modern scientific applications. For example, kernel-based algorithms take a data set of size N, form the kernel matrix of size N x N, and then perform an eigendecomposition or inversion at a cost of O(N^3) operations. For data sets of size N >= 10^5, kernel learning is too expensive, straining the limits of personal workstations and even dedicated <b>comput</b>ing clusters. Randomized ite ...</p>
