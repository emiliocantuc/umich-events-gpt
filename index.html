Monday, Jan. 29, 2024 (2 PM – 3:30 PM)

Elizabeth Tibbetts
University of Michigan

Why do animals differ in their cognitive abilities? Some animals fail at apparently simple tasks, while others have a remarkable capacity to collect, retain, and use information from the environment to guide their behavior. Although paper wasps brains are smaller than a grain of rice, Tibbetts will show that wasps can perform seemingly complex behav ...</p>

To answer this question, Fair Enough? proposes a new framework for studying attitudes toward redistributive social policies in times of rising inequality. These attitudes, Cavaille argues, are shaped by at least two motives. First, people support policies that increase their own expected income. Second, they support policies that move the status quo closer to what is prescribed by shared norms of fairness. In most circumstances, say ...</p>

Abstract: Complex adaptive systems science provides ways to examine relationships among individuals in the archaeological past. Through these methods we directly observe the impacts of individuals’ decisions (in the case of agent-based modeling) or their relationships to other individuals (in the case of network analysis) and then examine the effects of these behaviors on larger societal structures.
