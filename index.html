A central task in protein design is to identify a diverse set of stabilizing scaffolds to support a motif known or theorized to confer function.

            <p class="card-text">Existing algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods rely on assumptions about the near-kernel components of a given linear system. Namely, that these components are "smooth" in the sense that they can be sufficiently approximated by few degrees of freedom. PDEs with higher order terms violate these assumptions, causing an unbounded number of $V$-cycles for convergence. As an example, we introduce a PDE that arises in kinetic-edge plasma simulation. This PDE contains an isotropic fourth-order term, making ...</p>
