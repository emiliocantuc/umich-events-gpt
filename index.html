            <p class="card-text">Evaluating the risk associated to a portfolio is important to
regulators, market exchanges and investors. The value-at-risk (VaR)
and expected shortfall (ES) remain the most widely used risk measures
in finance. Given a portfolio of future random loss X and a confidence
level c in (0,1), the VaR represents the quantile of X at level c (P(X
VaR) = 1-c) and the ES the average loss given that X exceeds the
VaR, i.e. the superquantile of X at level c (ES = E[X|X > VaR]).
