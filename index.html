            <p class="card-text">Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this non-differentiability fall roughly into ...</p>

Abstract:
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for multiple neurological disorders, including advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), through continuous high-frequency brain stimulation. While its clinical benefits are well documented, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Due to the anatomical and cellular heterogeneity of brain tissue, DBS can modulate diverse neuronal elements and circuits at ...</p>
