In the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs, Anishinaabe leaders granted land to a college where their children could be educated. At the time, the colonial settlement of Anishinaabe homeland hardly extended beyond Detroit in what settlers called the “Michigan Territory.” Four days after the Treaty of Fort Meigs was signed, the First College of Michigania was founded to claim the Anishina ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Muon colliders have recently emerged as an exciting option to access the 10 TeV energy scale. However, significant research and development is required to address the fundamental challenge that muons are unstable, and will decay continuously while moving through an accelerator complex. In addition, any detector will see a very large beam-induced background (BIB) from the decay of muons in the colliding beams. In this talk, I will introduce and motivate the concept of a muon collider, discuss som ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">The fundamental properties of the RNA double helix—high structural stability and strict base-pairing specificity—have profoundly influenced biological systems throughout evolutionary history and up to today. While the stability allows helices to serve as rigid scaffolds within structured RNAs, it also creates significant energetic barriers to rearrangement, necessitating RNA helicases as chaperones in RNA folding and remodeling. At the same time, the high specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing ...</p>
