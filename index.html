            <p class="card-text">ABSTRACT: U.S. and Europe-based banks and international financial institutions including the IMF have been central to critical accounts of Africa’s place in global capitalism. And yet since 2008 these institutions have been in retreat on the continent, partially replaced by Pan African Banks. Putting ethnographic work with Africa-based finance professionals into dialogue with heterodox economic thinking on banks and currency sovereignty, I argue that we must not only analyze the geographic shift ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The exploratory and interactive nature of modern data analysis often introduces selection bias, posing challenges for traditional statistical inference methods. A common strategy to address this bias is by conditioning on the selection event.

            <p class="card-text">Given the state of a system is not completely observable, filtering is concerned with state estimation based on partial observations of the system state.

Abstract: In many social species, individuals create their social worlds through interaction decisions and are then subject to and constrained by these social constructs, which can affect an individual’s future actions. Understanding how much individuals “know” about their social worlds is critical in understanding potential feedbacks between sociality and cognition. However, it is difficult to determine how much i ...</p>
