            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Oct 23 15:30 - 17:00. Workshop / Seminar. Off Campus Location</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Learning to read scholarly articles can feel like learning a whole new language. With that in mind, this workshop is designed to help you <b>hack</b> that process and get better acquainted with scholarly writing. You will learn tools for better understanding articles in your discipline, including easier and quicker spotting of main findings, conclusions, and how to summarize this information.

The workshops are open to any undergraduate student on campus.

            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Oct 22 16:00 - 17:00. Workshop / Seminar. East Hall</h6>
            <p class="card-text">In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a modelfree manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model P (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model Q (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between P and Q in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric AW 2. Impor ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Join Dr. Ryan Cory-Wright, Assistant Professor of Analytics and Operations at Imperial College Business School, for a seminar exploring new approaches to solving low-rank optimization problems inspired by the landmark Goemans–Williamson <b>algo</b>rithm.
