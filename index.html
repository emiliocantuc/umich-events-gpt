            <p class="card-text">About the presentation: Phytoplankton are key primary producers performing half of Earth’s carbon fixation, forming the base of aquatic food webs, driving major biogeochemical cycles and affecting water quality. Understanding how phytoplankton respond to changing environmental conditions, including global climate change, is critical for our ability to predict the fate and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

This builds on prior work of Seidel (who proved the theorem in the case of the quartic surface), Sheridan, Lekili--Ueda, and Ganatra--Pardon--Shende.
