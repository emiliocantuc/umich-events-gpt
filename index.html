            <p class="card-text">Thermal transport in solid materials plays a crucial role in every modern application, ranging from batteries to nuclear technology. In semiconductors, both mobile electrons and lattice vibrations quantifiably contribute to heat transport. In these materials, several engineering principles are known and largely used to tune heat conduction, like nano-structuring, doping, etc. However, the interplay of crystal structure, symmetry and chemical bonding on thermal conduction are still not well under ...</p>
