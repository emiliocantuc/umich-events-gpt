Processes involving pairs of Higgs bosons are a sensitive probe of new physics and will ultimately allow the shape of the (in)famous Higgs potential to be directly explored experimentally.

            <p class="card-text">Join us on March 13 as our guest, John Urschel, gives his talk titled "Numerical Stability in Gaussian Elimination."

Abstract: The solution of a linear system, i.e., given a matrix A and vector b, finding a vector x satisfying Ax = b, is one of the oldest problems in mathematics. Gaussian elimination is one of the most fundamental and well-known techniques for solving linear systems, by factoring a matrix into the product of a lower and upper triangular matrix. Surprisingly, a number of quest ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide powerful optimal treatment searching <b>algo</b>rithms, which are tailored to individuals’ specific needs and able to maximize their expected clinical benefits. However, existing <b>algo</b>rithms could suffer from insufficient sample size under optimal treatments, especially for chronic diseases involving long stages of decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individualized learning method which estim ...</p>
