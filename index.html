            <p class="card-text">Mean field games (MFG) and mean field control (MFC) problems have been introduced to study large populations of strategic players. They correspond respectively to non-cooperative or cooperative scenarios, and the goals of their analyses are to find the Nash equilibriums and social optimums. These frameworks provide approximate solutions to situations with a finite number of players and have found a wide range of applications, from economics to biology and <b>machine learning</b>. In this paper,  ...</p>
