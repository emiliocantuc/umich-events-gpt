Abstract:
How do we move a robot quickly from one position to another? To answer this question, we need to understand its “space of possibilities”, a “map” where we can find every possible position of the robot. Unfortunately, these spaces are very large, they live in very high-dimensions, and they are very difficult to visualize. Fortunately, mathematicians have encountered and studied these kinds of spaces before. Thanks to the tools they’ve developed, we can bu ...</p>

            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Jan 24 15:00 - 16:00. Workshop / Seminar. East Hall</h6>
            <p class="card-text">This talk will survey the extremal theory of pattern-avoiding 0-1 matrices and some of their applications in geometry and <b>algo</b>rithms.  If P is a 0-1 matrix, Ex(P,n) is the maximum number of 1s in an n x n 0-1 matrix that does not contain any submatrix that dominates P.  Every 0-1 pattern P can be regarded as the incidence matrix of a bipartite graph, in which the two sides of the bipartition are ordered.  Thus, this definition can be seen as a generalization of the Turan extremal function ...</p>
