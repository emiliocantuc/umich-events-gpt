            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The main goal of transfer learning strategies is to enhance the efficiency of learning models applied to target tasks by transferring knowledge from similar, yet distinct, source tasks. These strategies are particularly useful when it is excessively costly or impractical to collect an ample volume of training data in the target domain, because by borrowing strength from the source, they can significantly reduce the sample requirement in the target. This has led transfer learning to be  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Dependency among observations can arise from a multitude of sources, including spatial or temporal correlation, grouped, clustered or repeated measurements, hierarchical structures, and dyadic interactions. Neglecting these interdependencies in statistical analyses may result in incorrect inferences or loss of statistical power. Conversely, adequately modeling these dependencies not only enhances the validity of our statistical inferences but also deepens our comprehension of the intricate dynam ...</p>

My lab is dedicated to developing translational approaches for regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues. My PhD training focused on understanding the role of the stem cell niche and regulating the in vitro environment to regulate the growth and differentiation characteristics of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Subsequent studies during post-doctoral training focused on the cultivation of large tissue engineered constructs. A major component of these studies was ...</p>
