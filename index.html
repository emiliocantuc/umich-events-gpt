In statistics, posterior sampling offers a flexible inferential framework, enabling uncertainty quantification, probabilistic prediction, as well as the estimation of intractable quantities. In generative AI, sampling aims to generate unseen instances that emulate a target population, such as the natural distributions of texts, images, and molecules.

            <p class="card-text">Chromatin organization controls DNA’s accessibility to regulatory factors to influence gene expression. Heterochromatin, or transcriptionally silent chromatin enriched in methylated DNA and methylated histone tails, self-assembles through multivalent interactions with its associated proteins into a condensed, but dynamic state. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of key heterochromatin regulators, such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), plays an essential role in heterochromatin assembly and  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Despite hundreds of searches, no clear evidence of beyond standard model particles have been found at the LHC so far. However, there still remains a huge landscape of possible signals hiding in LHC data, which is very difficult to fully cover with traditional strategies. Recently, a new class of ‘anomaly detection’ techniques have been developed which aim to cover as much of this landscape as possible so that potential discoveries are not missed. These techniques leverage novel data-driven <b>ma ...</p>

However,  despite the remarkable empirical successes of deep learners, the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which deep learners are generally applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a t ...</p>

In statistics, posterior sampling offers a flexible inferential framework, enabling uncertainty quantification, probabilistic prediction, as well as the estimation of intractable quantities. In generative AI, sampling aims to generate unseen instances that emulate a target population, such as the natural distributions of texts, images, and molecules.
