            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The non-backtracking operator, an asymmetric matrix constructed from an undirected graph, connects to various aspects of graph theory, including random walks, graph zeta functions, and expander graphs. It has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing sparse random graphs, leading to significant advancements with established results for sparse random matrices using this operator. Additionally, algorithms employing the non-backtracking operator have achieved optimal sample complexity in m ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Overnutrition, physical inactivity and genetic aberrations promote the accumulation of fat-derived molecules in tissues not suited for lipid storage, leading to tissue dysfunction that underlies diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Of the myriad of lipids that accumulate, sphingolipids such as ceramides may be among the most deleterious, as they alter metabolic programs and induce apoptosis and fibrosis. 

In humans, serum ceramides are strong biomarkers of diabetes and major adverse cardiac e ...</p>

Imaging deep inside living organisms with cellular resolution remains challenging as recurrent scattering by submicron-scale heterogeneous structures degrades the image-bearing capability of light. In this talk, I will present my work on imaging through turbid tissues with improved resolution and sensitivity using interferometric techniques and computational algorithms. I will first discuss how quantitative phase imaging (QPI) improves contrast and sensitivity in three-dimensional cel ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Estimating the full (conditional) distribution is crucial to applications that require uncertainty quantification. However, existing methods such as quantile regression typically fall short for high-dimensional response variables, such as spatial fields of climate variables. To address this, distributional learning aims to estimate a generative model to describe the target distribution, which enables inference by sampling. In this talk, we introduce a distributional learning method cal ...</p>

Whereas some couples faltered under the pressure of balancing work and family during the height of the pandemic, others thrived. Shaping these experiences was the widespread adoption of remote work which gave rise to various possible work from home configurations among couples. Further, the closures of daycare centers and schools created added strain on the lives of dual-earning couples with young children. This presentation is t ...</p>
