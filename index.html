Overview: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every aspect of our society and revolutionizing academic research. Powerful new systems like Generative AI unlocks enormous potential to accelerate research, “mass produce” human knowledge, and enable humans to address previously unfathomable scientific questions and engineering challenges. Meanwhile, such potential is still largely speculative and initial successes are still limited in scope. Mas ...</p>

Many plasmas are not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and describing their evolution is a forefront research area across plasma science.  Often, the evolution of non-LTE plasmas is interpreted using the first few fluid moments of the phase space density – density, momentum, bulk kinetic energy, and internal energy.  However, for a system not in LTE, there are an infinite number of possible moments of the phase space density that can be important.  The evolution of higher orde ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">The arc space of an algebraic variety parametrizes formal germs of smooth curves mapping into the variety. It is an infinite dimensional scheme whose geometry can be used to analyze and control invariants of singularities. Traditionally this is done by focusing on the topological structure of arc spaces, but recent developments suggest that its scheme structure (its singularities, its non-reduced scheme structure) should also play an important role. For instance, embedding dimensions and codimen ...</p>

Preview: When most people think about how a mutation impacts phenotype, they think about changes at the organismal level. Does it predispose an individual to disease? Does it help bacteria resist drugs? But that’s not the whole story. Every mutation has an impact at the molecular level, for example, by changing the level of a transcript or the fold of a protein. These effects fan out to influence other phenotypes, ultimately causing c ...</p>
