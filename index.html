            <p class="card-text">"Succeeding to previous regimes of migrants as laboring (Sayad 2004) and suffering bodies (Fassin 2013, Ticktin 2011), and to the trauma regime of victimhood (Fassin and Rechtman 2009), a trauma regime of survival is emerging in public discourses, re-shaping psychotherapeutic practices and migration policies.

            <p class="card-text">Extant mammals move in many ways, from walking and running to swimming and climbing. How can we compare locomotion across taxa, both extant and extinct, to understand how these different styles of movement evolved through time? For any organism, locomotion is a complex combination of (1) its capacity for movement as constrained by its morphology, (2) the behaviors that the organism employs within its biomechanical limits, and (3) the habitat(s) through which the organism moves. Traditionally, th ...</p>

This is made possible by a diverse and dynamic repertoire of lymphocytes expressing unique antigen receptors and capable of rapid evolution within an individual.

            <p class="card-text">The Axiom of Choice, now used throughout non-foundational mathematics with minimal hesitation, has an extremely interesting history and many non-trivial consequences.

First formulated explicitly by Ernst Zermelo to solve the so-called Well-Ordering Problem, this axiom sparked debates throughout the mathematical community. David Hilbert, arguably one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, described Choice as the axiom "most attacked up to the present in the mathematical literature;" and i ...</p>
