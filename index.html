            <p class="card-text">Taut foliations have been a classical object of study in 3-manifolds theory. Recently, new interest in them has come from the investigation of the so-called "L-space conjecture", that predicts that manifolds containing a co-orientable taut foliation can be characterised in terms of their Heegaard Floer homology and their fundamental group. A possible approach to the study of this conjecture is analysing Dehn surgeries on knots and links. Most of the techniques employed for constructing taut foli ...</p>
