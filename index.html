            <p class="card-text">Cosmic rays with energies up to a few PeV are believed to originate from our own galaxy. However, thir origin has remained a mystery for over a century since the discovery. Recent discoveries in neutrino and gamma-ray astronomy have provided strong evidence for the existence of PeV particle accelerators, or PeVatrons, within the Milky Way galaxy. Among them, the H.E.S.S. observatory discovered a PeVatron within 10 parsecs of the center of our galaxy, suggesting that the supermassive black hole S ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Eliciting the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in surveys has become an important source of data for both researchers and policymakers. This talk will report on survey experiments designed to study two puzzles that have emerged in this literature. The between-study puzzle is that average MPCs vary substantially across surveys. We show in a randomized survey experiment that elicited MPCs are quite sensitive to question wording. The within-study puzzle is that that elicited MPCs are poorly cor ...</p>

Quantum optics investigates the interactions between light and matter at their most fundamental level. In recent years, we have witnessed remarkable advances in controlling individual photons and other excitations, such as spin, charge, excitons, and phonons, in solid-state systems. While this progress has primarily been driven by quantum information science (QIS), its implications extend far beyond QIS. In this ta ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Distributional regression aims to estimate the full conditional distribution of a target variable, given covariates. Traditional approaches include linear or tree-based quantile regression. Modern <b>comput</b>ational-intensive approaches include diffusion models and flow matching. It is shown how a simple extension of the absolute error loss of standard regression yields a light-weight generative model that can easily be extended to very high-dimensional targets. It also can be used i ...</p>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) using an operator network. This method combines the strengths of deep learning with traditional numerical techniques, specifically the finite element or spectral element methods, to address parametric PDEs ranging from singularly perturbed convection-diffusi ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">We study renormalization group flows in far-from-equilibrium states. The study is made tractable by focusing on states that are spatially homogeneous, time-independent, and scale invariant. Such states, in which mode k has occupation number $n_k = k^{-\gamma}$, are well-known in nonlinear physics (going under the name of wave turbulence). RG flow in such states is qualitatively different than in the vacuum -- a positive $\gamma$ decreases the dimension of an operator, turning marginal interactio ...</p>
