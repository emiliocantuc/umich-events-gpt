The last several years have brought notable successes in the application of <b>machine learning</b> approaches, and especially deep learning models, to problems in single-cell and regulatory genomics.  The advent of single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and multiome (scRNA+ATAC-seq) brings new <b>machine learning</b> challenges and opportunities to link chromatin state to developmental trajectories, gene regulation, and even higher order chromatin organization. We will pr ...</p>
