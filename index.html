In generative modeling, one seeks to artificially generate new data that belongs to given input class.  For instance, generating new faces from a database of celebrity faces.   Mathematically, this can be posed as finding a map that pushes a simple concrete probability distribution, such as a standard Gaussian, to a complicated abstract distribution that is only known  ...</p>

Renée DiResta studies adversarial abuse online—ways that people attempt to manipulate, harass, or target others within the constantly evolving landscape of digital platforms. She will discuss her empirical research on the ways propagandists deliberately undermine belief in the legitimacy of institutions that make society work and share how she translates her work into policy suggestions to mitigate online information manipulation. Drawing on her personal experience coming under fire for her pub ...</p>

Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of single-cell data analysis is critical, particularly in visualizing complex biological structures and addressing data sparsity. This talk introduces two novel statistical methods—scDEED and mcRigor—that leverage permutation-based techniques to enhance the rigor of these analyses.

            <p class="card-text">Motivated by our search for a representation-theoretic avatar of double Grothendieck polynomials G_w(x;y), we give a new formula for G_w(x;y) based on Magyar's orthodontia <b>algo</b>rithm for diagrams. We obtain a similar formula for double Schubert polynomials S_w(x;y), and a curious positivity result: For vexillary permutations w, the polynomial x_1^n \dots x_n^n S_w(x_n^{-1}, \dots, x_1^{-1}; 1, \dots, 1) is a graded nonnegative sum of Lascoux polynomials.
