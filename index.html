Traditional biomedical imaging techniques face throughput bottlenecks that limit our ability to study complex dynamic samples like cells, organoids, tissues, and organisms.

In November 2022, ChatGPT stunned the world by displaying abilities – answering questions, reasoning about problems, composing stories, writing code – that appear eerily “human-like”.  Dramatic advances in artificial intelligence such as these raise pressing questions: What is intelligence? In what ways can models such as ChatGPT be said to possess it? In what ways do these ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract:  Neurons in cortex are connected in intricate patterns, with local- and long-range connections and distance-dependent time delays for transmitting signals. In recent work, we have found that spontaneous and stimulus-driven waves of neural activity travel over these networks, sparsely modulating the spiking activity of the local network as they pass. The waves represent changes in the moment-by-moment activity state of these networks, which in turn directly shapes neuronal responses to  ...</p>
