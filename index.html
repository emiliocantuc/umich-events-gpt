Abstract:
Conventional optical imaging systems have difficulties scaling to high spatiotemporal throughput, rendering it challenging or impossible to study complex and highly dynamic biological systems. In particular, due to physical limitations of hardware-only systems, it is difficult to develop imaging systems that can capture multidimensional information about dynamic samples at high resolution, wide fields of ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract:  Models of aperiodic order and quasicrystals tend to exhibit very delicate spectral properties, such as Cantor spectrum and fractal spectral dimension. We discuss algorithms for <b>comput</b>ing spectral quantities associated with models of aperiodic order. The algorithms are optimal with respect the solvability <b>comput</b>ability index (SCI), which can be shown by synthesizing tools from SCI and the general theory of ergodic Schrödinger operators.
