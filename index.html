            <p class="card-text">Abstract: The non-backtracking operator, an asymmetric matrix constructed from an undirected graph, connects to various aspects of graph theory, including random walks, graph zeta functions, and expander graphs. It has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing sparse random graphs, leading to significant advancements with established results for sparse random matrices using this operator. Additionally, algorithms employing the non-backtracking operator have achieved optimal sample complexity in m ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Snacks and coffee will be served. 

*Abstract:* In this talk I will discuss some aspects at the intersection of machine learning and networks, and introduce interdisciplinary methods for data-driven analysis of social and biological complex systems. 

First, I will present some nuanced aspects of social media. In recent work, we study, using knowledge graphs, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing, how online hate speech and public sentiment evolves for different marginalized gr ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Overnutrition, physical inactivity and genetic aberrations promote the accumulation of fat-derived molecules in tissues not suited for lipid storage, leading to tissue dysfunction that underlies diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Of the myriad of lipids that accumulate, sphingolipids such as ceramides may be among the most deleterious, as they alter metabolic programs and induce apoptosis and fibrosis. 

In humans, serum ceramides are strong biomarkers of diabetes and major adverse cardiac e ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract:
Imaging deep inside living organisms with cellular resolution remains challenging as recurrent scattering by submicron-scale heterogeneous structures degrades the image-bearing capability of light. In this talk, I will present my work on imaging through turbid tissues with improved resolution and sensitivity using interferometric techniques and computational algorithms. I will first discuss how quantitative phase imaging (QPI) improves contrast and sensitivity in three-dimensional cel ...</p>
