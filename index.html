Combining global data on deforestation and daily temperature realizations at the one-degree grid-cell level from 2001-2019, we show that each additional degree day above 32 °C increases deforestation at the forest edge by 0.25 percentage points. These effects accumulate over time and are driven by tropical regions. Consistent with heat-induced declines in agricultural productivity as the drivi ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Matching promises simple and transparent causal inferences for observational data, making it an attractive approach in many settings, especially given its easily communicated and intuitive rationale. Matching methods “match” treated units to control units with similar covariates, with the goal of achieving joint covariate balance between treated and control units, as would be expected in a randomized experiment. In practice, however, standard matching methods often perform poorly compared to mor ...</p>

Abstract:
Healthcare constitutes nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy and approximately 10% of the global economy, yet it faces profound challenges, including inequitable access, an aging population, and rising per capita costs. These factors underscore the urgent need for innovative solutions. In this talk, we will present how artificial intelligence, driven by the urgent needs of healthcare, is advancing both clinical an ...</p>
