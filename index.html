Unlike crystalline materials, the packing structure in a disordered material is often hard to describe mathematically, which prohibits us from understanding the deformation from a structure-property point of view.

Something very strange seems to have happened a long time ago in a far-off land: a fortune-telling book was made the basis of a philosophical tradition. How did this system of prognostication come to be viewed as the ultimate authority in matters of cosmology, metaphysics, politics and ethics? With what consequences, and on what premises? How does this differ from traditions that take a different bit of their seemingly  ...</p>
