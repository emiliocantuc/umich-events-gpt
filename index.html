            <p class="card-text">Abstract:
Neural interfaces can restore or augment sensorimotor capabilities by converting high-bandwidth biological signals into control signals for an external device via a decoder algorithm. Users adapt their behavior in these interfaces via sensorimotor learning and decoder algorithms can adapt via machine learning. Leveraging user and decoder adaptation presents opportunities to improve usability and personalize devices. But we have limited understanding of how user and decoder learning in ...</p>
