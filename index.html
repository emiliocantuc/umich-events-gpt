            <p class="card-text">The standard Kleiman-Bertini transversality theorems say that if a variety is homogeneous with respect to the action of an algebraic group, then this action moves any two subvarieties into transverse position. I will describe refinements which treat cases where the action is not transitive, along with an application to the positivity of cohomology and K-theory classes of subvarieties of a generalized flag variety.</p>
