            <p class="card-text">Abstract:  The total electron content (TEC) maps can be used to estimate the signal delay of GPS due to the ionospheric electron content between a receiver and a satellite. This delay can result in a GPS positioning error. Thus, it is important to monitor and forecast the TEC maps. However, the observed TEC maps have big patches of missingness in the ocean and scattered small areas on the land. Thus, precise imputation and prediction of the TEC maps are crucial in space weather forecasting.
